A small php file to upload resume via oAuth to agiliq.
======================================================

Firstly , i got the access token by exchanging the authorization tokes(both client id and client secret).

Then using the access token i uploaded my details by making a simple HTML form and submitting it to http://join.agiliq.com/api/resume/upload/?access_token=something

Run the file to enter details and submit it.
